# Gameplay Randomizer Hack Plan

## Summary
Build a per-save deterministic gameplay randomizer on top of `pokeemerald-expansion` stable `1.16.2`, keeping Emerald's map/story for now. Each save gets one randomizer seed; the same species always has the same randomized ability and learnset within that save, including after evolution.

## Key Changes
- Add randomizer config gates, default enabled for this hack:
  - Randomized encounters from all enabled Pokemon through Gen 9.
  - Randomized species abilities, stable across each evolution line.
  - Randomized learnsets, weighted toward the Pokemon's type.
  - Hard Emerald gym-based level caps.
  - No EV gain.
  - Friendship evolutions replaced by level evolutions.
- Store one `u32 randomizerSeed` in save data and initialize it during new-game setup.
- Add deterministic helper functions:
  - `GetRandomizerSeed()`
  - `RandomizerHash(category, species/map/slot/etc.)`
  - `GetRandomizedSpeciesForEncounter(originalSpecies, map, encounterType, slot)`
  - `GetRandomizedAbilityNumForSpecies(species)`
  - `GetRandomizedLevelUpMove(species, learnLevel, slot)`
- Randomization must be stable for a save, but different across new saves.

## Gameplay Implementation
- Encounters:
  - Intercept wild encounter species selection after the vanilla encounter slot is chosen.
  - Preserve encounter levels, encounter method, and slot rarity.
  - Replace species with a deterministic random species from enabled Pokemon.
  - Exclude invalid entries: `SPECIES_NONE`, eggs, disabled species, battle-only forms, unusable forms.
- Abilities:
  - Choose one legal randomized ability per evolution family/base species.
  - Apply the same ability slot result to all members of that evolution line.
  - Player, wild, gift, and trainer Pokemon all resolve through the same deterministic ability logic unless a battle gimmick/form explicitly overrides ability.
- Moves:
  - Keep move data itself intact: move power/type/effect are not randomized.
  - Randomize level-up learnsets at runtime or generated table time using deterministic seed logic.
  - Weight candidate moves toward Pokemon typing: strong preference for STAB, secondary preference for coverage/status, reject unusable/special-case moves.
  - Same species gets the same learnset across encounters in the same save.
- Level caps / EVs:
  - Set `B_EXP_CAP_TYPE = EXP_CAP_HARD`.
  - Set `B_LEVEL_CAP_TYPE = LEVEL_CAP_FLAG_LIST`.
  - Set `B_RARE_CANDY_CAP = TRUE`.
  - Keep existing Emerald cap table initially: 15, 19, 24, 29, 31, 33, 42, 46, champion 58.
  - Set `B_EV_CAP_TYPE = EV_CAP_NO_GAIN`; hide/avoid EV-focused UI where practical.
- QoL:
  - Add two reusable Key Items:
    - Level Capper: choose a party Pokemon and raise it to the current cap, respecting evolution/learn-move flow.
    - Portable Healer: heal party outside battle using existing party-heal behavior.
  - Grant both Key Items early in the game, preferably during starter/new-game setup.
- Friendship evolutions:
  - Replace all `IF_MIN_FRIENDSHIP` evolution conditions with level-based equivalents:
    - Baby/early evolutions: level 20.
    - Midgame evolutions: level 30.
    - Special/late evolutions: level 40.
  - Preserve extra conditions where meaningful, such as day/night or known move type, unless they depended only on friendship.

## Test Plan
- Build with `make -j$(nproc)`.
- Start two new saves and confirm encounter/ability/learnset randomization differs between saves.
- Within one save, confirm repeated encounters of the same species have consistent ability and learnset.
- Confirm evolution preserves the randomized ability behavior for that evolution line.
- Confirm Pokemon at cap gain no EXP and Rare Candy/EXP Candy cannot exceed cap.
- Confirm EVs do not increase from battle or EV items.
- Confirm friendship evolution species evolve by the new level thresholds.
- Confirm Level Capper and Portable Healer work outside battle and are blocked or harmless in battle.

## Assumptions
- Base branch remains `codex/stable-1.16.2`.
- Pokemon pool is all enabled species/forms through Gen 9, filtered for validity.
- Randomization is per-save deterministic, not build-time static and not rerolled every encounter.
- Move randomization means randomized learnsets, not randomized move effects/power/type.
- Initial level caps use Emerald's existing cap values.
